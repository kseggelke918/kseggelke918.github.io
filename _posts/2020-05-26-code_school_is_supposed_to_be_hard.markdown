I had to remind myself of something recently - This is **hard**, and that's ok because this is hard for almost everyone!  

My entire academic career, like most, was a series of subjects that were built off things I had already learned.  When learning to read, kids first learn the letters of the alphabet.  Then they learn the sounds each letter makes and then they start putting those sounds together to form words.  Learning more and more words by sounding them out or memorizing them until they are reading entire books.  When learning math, every class taken is a continuation of what was learned in previous math classes.  Just about everything learned in traditional schooling was built on something learned previously.  

So here's what makes code school so hard: we don't start off with any previous knowledge!  So many of us start with limited knowledge about how the internet even works, let alone how code itself works or is written.  So on top of understanding that code makes the internet world go round, we also have to learn a completely new language, but unlike learning Spanish or French or Russian or any other language, you can't just look at a picture of a ball and learn that it is a pelota, balle or мяч., you have to understand the concepts at the same time.  And just when you get a handle on it, you have to learn a whole other language that may have similar concepts, but is written in a whole new way!

So please, be kind to yourself.  This is hard, and it's supposed to be that way!  Frustration happens, anger happens, breakdowns happen.  It's ok to call it a day, take a walk, grab lunch or rage run.  Just keep it in perspective.  I promise that even if your classmates all seem to have it figured out, they probably don't and are probably just as stumped as you are sometimes!  You aren't alone, you aren't stupid and you can do this!
